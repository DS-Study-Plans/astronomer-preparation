There are some commons architectures that are implemented:

## One Node:

All the components of Airflow run in the same machine.
The webserver interacts with the metastore, the scheduler records in the metastore
and creates a task instance, that task instance is send to the (queue) executor; the
executor itself, goes to the metastore to update the status of the task.

## Multi Nodes (Celery):

Usually the web server, scheduler and executor runs in the same node, but the 
metastore and queue runs in a different node.
The tasks are executed in independent workers nodes.
