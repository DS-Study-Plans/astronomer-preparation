## DAGs:

Directed acyclic graph, it has nodes and edges, the edges are directed, there is no loop.
In Airflow represents a pipeline, each node is an operator

## Operators:
There are three kind of operators:

* **Action operators:** Allows executing something in the pipeline
* **Transfer operators:** Allows transferring data from a source to a destiny
* **Sensor Operators:** It helps when the task must wait to something happens, like 
the presence of a file in a folder
  
## Tasks:

An instance of an operator

## Task instance:

Represents a specific run of a task: DAG + Task + Point in time

## Dependencies

Specifies the relation between a set of tasks, it can me set in python using
the set_upstream, set_downstream or the <<OR>> Operator

## Workflow

Is the combination of all the previous concepts.
