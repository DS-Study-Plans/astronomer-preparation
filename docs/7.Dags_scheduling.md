There are three parameters relevant to the scheduling process:

* **start_date:** When the dag will start to be scheduled
* **schedule_interval:** With which frequency the dag will be triggered
* **end_date:** Optional parameter until the dag will run

The first time the dag is trigger is in the start_date + schedule_interval, not at start_date
The execution date is the start_date of that dag run

So for the second dag run, the start_date becomes the previous start_date + schedule interval
and when the dag finished, this is also the execution date

All the dates are stored and defined at UTC

If the start_date is in the pass, airflow will run all non triggered dag runs by default. To
avoid this, you can use the parameter

schedule_interval can be a cron expression or a time delta, to see what a cron means can use

For example to run a dag every 10 minutes:

*/10 * * * *

Using the timedelta defines a dag run every interval time, cron uses a absolute time frame.

If schedule_interval is None, it will never automatically trigger a dag run
