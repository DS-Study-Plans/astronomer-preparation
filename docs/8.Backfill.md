By default, once a dag is resumed, all the not triggered dag runs will be triggered.

To disable this behavior, the bool parameter catchup, if set to False, only the latest
non triggered dag will be trigger.

If you want to make a catchup but in a restricted number of runs, the parameter 
max_active_runs can be set, it will restrict the number of active dag runs that can run
at the same time
